# 1. Lists 
This directory contains some python exercises regarding lists and some other collections.

## 1.1 print_list.py
Given two lists of student names and grades:

```python
student_names = ["juan", "ana", "jose", "raul", "sara", "thais"]
student_grades = [90, 60, 70, 60, 55, 40]
```

Write a function that receives both lists and prints the data as follows:

```python
>>> print_students(names, grades)
Students:
1. juan: 90
2. ana: 60
3. jose: 70
4. raul: 60
5. sara: 55
6. thais: 40
>>> 
```
